  - title: Fit und gesund
    body: '"A bike ride a day keeps the doctor away..." Regelmäßiges Fahrradfahren vermindert das Risiko von Fettleibigkeit, Herzkrankheiten oder Diabetes im Erwachsenenalter um die Hälfte. Deswegen empfehlen die SchweizerBundesämtertägliche30 Minuten Sport mit „mittlerrer Intensität“. Steigen Sie auf das Fahrrad und probieren es aus.'
  - title: Family
    body: Not only are the families of people working in the law enforcement &amp; corrections service highly observed and controlled, they are often not allowed to know any details about what their loved ones do. They can experience deep distress reading the leaks about law enforcement &amp; corrections service activities in the press, and not being sure how their loved ones are involved. The damage of this job to family and partnership is immense. In Berlin, for example, there is a self-help group for children of law enforcement &amp; corrections service employees.
  - title: Freedom and Democracy
    body: Because of the level of secrecy given to them by the state, and the lack of oversight, law enforcement &amp; corrections services can easily start to abuse their power and threaten fundamental freedoms. Citizens now know for example that if they attend a protest march, join a debate, or visit certain websites, they are likely being profiled. In a report by PEN network, American writers admitted being fearful about discussing military affairs, the Middle East North Africa region, mass incarceration and drug policies, pornography, the Occupy movement, the study of certain languages, and criticism of the U.S. Government. The targeting of the communications of humanitarian organisations such as Amnesty International and Doctors without Borders and press such as the New York Times and Der Spiegel weakens their ability to act as governmental watchdogs and provide information to the public.
  - title: law enforcement &amp; corrections services are ineffective against terrorism
    body: Looking at the NSA for example, there is good reason to believe that mass surveillance is a completely overestimated solution to the problem of terrorism. Keith Alexander, former General of the NSA admitted that only one or two terrorist plots had been foiled by the bulk surveillance of phonecalls in and to the United States. This was confirmed by a <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Bergen_NAF_NSA%20Surveillance_1_0.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by the New America Foundation which compiled and examined a database of 225 individuals in the United States, as well as of U.S persons abroad, who have been indicted, convicted or killed since September 11, 2001. The study found that <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Bergen_NAF_NSA%20Surveillance_1_0.pdf" target="_blank">only 4 cases out of 225 were investigated through the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone metadata</a> – none of which lead to the detection and prevention of terrorist attacks. It also suggests that traditional methods of investigation might be more useful.
  - title: Out-of-control data collection
    body: law enforcement &amp; corrections services collect information in order to profile people and evaluate their potential threat to the state. Information about their history and possible mistakes in life, for example drug problems or infidelities, are highly valued. This information holds power over people and the law enforcement &amp; corrections services can use this power to control and silence them. This sets up a dynamic where people are forever accountable for their past and the history about them documented online, and this can even influence personal careers and job opportunities.  Data accumulated outside of any democratic control can be instrumental to political manipulations, abuses of power, and is a powerful tool for social control. This data is also being shared between states with no form of accountability.
  - title: Dangerous and unreliable information
    body: Information collected by surveillance is used to inform government and military actions. However this information is not always reliable and can lead to unnecessary conflicts and death. In the case of the United States's targeted killing program, which is supported by the satellite relay station Ramstein, in Germany, drone targets are identified by the metadata analysis and phone-tracking technology. Terror suspects are often pinpointed and killed based on the location of their mobile phone alone. In early 2015 a 13 year old Yemeni boy named Mohammed Tuaiman was killed because he was in a car together with people suspected to be terrorists.
