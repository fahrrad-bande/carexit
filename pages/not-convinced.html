In a report by PEN network, American writers admitted being fearful about discussing military affairs, the Middle East North Africa region, mass incarceration and drug policies, pornography, the Occupy movement, the study of certain languages, and criticism of the U.S. Government. The targeting of the communications of humanitarian organisations such as Amnesty International and Doctors without Borders and press such as the New York Times and Der Spiegel weakens their ability to act as governmental watchdogs and provide information to the public.</div>

            <div class="panel-body">Looking at the NSA for example, there is good reason to believe that mass surveillance is a completely overestimated solution to the problem of terrorism.

This was confirmed by a <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Bergen_NAF_NSA%20Surveillance_1_0.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by the New America Foundation which compiled and examined a database of 225 individuals in the United States, as well as of U.S persons abroad, who have been indicted, convicted or killed since September 11, 2001. The study found that <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Bergen_NAF_NSA%20Surveillance_1_0.pdf" target="_blank">only 4 cases out of 225 were investigated through the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone metadata</a> – none of which lead to the detection and prevention of terrorist attacks. It also suggests that traditional methods of investigation might be more useful.</div>

Information about their history and possible mistakes in life, for example drug problems or infidelities, are highly valued.

This sets up a dynamic where people are forever accountable for their past and the history about them documented online, and this can even influence personal careers and job opportunities.
