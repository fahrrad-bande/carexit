          <div class="panel-body">With the skills you have acquired during your career in intelligence, you should not have a problem finding another job. You could shift to a more open branch of the civil service or you could apply your skills to a completely new field like research or investigative journalism. Developers of surveillance systems can continue building software for schools or hospitals for example, or join an IT security firm.</div>

          <div class="panel-body">Don't worry. Real friends should stick with you if you leave your job. If your colleagues really care about you, they will understand and respect your decision. Maybe your actions will even inspire some of them to stand by their values too. Anyone who judges you for trusting your conscience is not really a friend at all, and probably not someone you want to be your friend because they are clearly afraid of social pressure and afraid of losing their privileges.</div>

        <div id="faq-acc-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">Yes. Any life-changing decision will also affect your loved ones but on the positive side it will probably bring you closer to them; in your new life you will be able to share more about your work without frightening them. Living with less stress can also have very positive effects on personal relationships. The main difficulty for your family is if the state decides to obstruct your exit and your chance to start afresh. This can happen if you intentionally whistleblow or even if you choose to speak openly about your work when you leave. It could then be difficult to find a new job in the civil service but there are certainly other fields who would be sympathetic.

        <div id="faq-acc-3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">It is of course not illegal to quit your job. The main issue of legality depends on whether you choose to whistleblow about the activities of the intelligence or not. If you leave quietly and stay silent about your reasons for leaving then you should not encounter any legal issues. However if you become an advocate against the intelligence agency's work, there are laws each country has which can be used against you. And if there is no law, they will likely find another way to sabotage your life. As experience has shown, they tend to not take this kind of behavior lightly. So think about this carefully and don't hesitate to consult us and our partners on a strategy.</div>

          <div class="panel-body">Time and deep thinking. Such a decision is not an easy one. It can take between two months and two full years to get to the point where you decide to leave. During this time, you can expect to experience a range of emotions: fear, guilt, confusion and anxiety. Try to take care of yourself during this time and make sure you stay informed about the issues you are troubled by. Also read the stories and study the strategies of those who left before you, you can learn a lot. If you can talk to someone you trust, who is not from the LEO and CO community.</div>
