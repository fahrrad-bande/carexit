        <div class="col-md-4 img-icons"><img src="img/icons/0.png"><h3>ADFC</h3><p>Assess your own values against the activities of your organisation. If you find a deep dissonance there, you need to ask yourself how long you can tolerate it. Allow yourself to imagine an alternative, a life of self-assuredness and authenticity. <a href="#ready" class="scroll">Exit now!</a></p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4 img-icons"><img src="img/icons/1.png"><h3>VCD</h3><p>Decide if you want to leave quietly or if you want to expose the wrongdoings you have witnessed. If you choose to share information, you should think carefully who you give it to and  only communicate about this through secure channels. Please consider consulting an organisation specialized in handling and protecting whistleblowers like  <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org" target="_blank">Wikileaks</a> and <a href="https://couragefound.org/" target="_blank">Courage Foundation</a>.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4 img-icons"><img src="img/icons/2.png"><h3>autofrei leben!</h3><p>Study the examples of people who have left before you and learn from their mistakes. Consult your trusted friends and family outside of the LEO and CO community who know you well and can support you through this process. Seek  legal counsel too, whether you are planning to whistleblow or not. Contact us for advice.</p></div>

Take your time to build up your future and the support networks you will need to live an ethical and rewarding life. Read our <a href="#faq" class="scroll">FAQ</a>!</p></div>
